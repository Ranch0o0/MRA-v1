        "full": "We prove that (Olivia=Knave, Alice=Spy, Ivy=Knave) is the unique solution by showing it is consistent and all alternatives lead to contradictions.\n\nStep 1: We first verify the proposed solution is consistent. Suppose Olivia=Knave, Alice=Spy, Ivy=Knave.\n\nStep 2: Check Olivia's statement \"Alice and I have the same role.\" Since Olivia=Knave and Alice=Spy, they do NOT have the same role. Olivia's statement is false. Since Olivia is a Knave (always lies), this is consistent.\n\nStep 3: Check Alice's statement \"I am a spy.\" Since Alice=Spy, her statement is true. Since Alice is the Spy (can lie or tell truth), speaking truth is consistent.\n\nStep 4: Check Ivy's statement \"Alice and I have the same role.\" Since Ivy=Knave and Alice=Spy, they do NOT have the same role. Ivy's statement is false. Since Ivy is a Knave (always lies), this is consistent.\n\nStep 5: Check the \"exactly one spy\" constraint (s-005). In our assignment: Olivia=Knave, Alice=Spy, Ivy=Knave. There is exactly one Spy (Alice). This is consistent with s-005.\n\nStep 6: The proposed solution satisfies all constraints. Therefore (Olivia=Knave, Alice=Spy, Ivy=Knave) is a valid solution.\n\nStep 7: We now show no other solution exists by case analysis on Alice's role. By s-001, Alice is Knight, Knave, or Spy.\n\nStep 8: Case A: Suppose Alice is a Knight (always tells truth). Alice says \"I am a spy\" (s-003). If Alice is a Knight, her statement must be true, so Alice is a Spy. But we assumed Alice is a Knight. Contradiction. Therefore Alice is not a Knight.\n\nStep 9: Case B: Suppose Alice is a Knave (always lies). Alice says \"I am a spy\" (s-003). If Alice is a Knave, her statement must be false, so Alice is NOT a spy. This is consistent so far. Continue to check other constraints.\n\nStep 10: Case B continued: If Alice=Knave, analyze Olivia. By s-005, there is exactly one spy, and it's not Alice. So the spy is either Olivia or Ivy.\n\nStep 11: Case B.1: Suppose Alice=Knave and Olivia=Spy. Olivia says \"Alice and I have the same role\" (s-002). Since Alice=Knave and Olivia=Spy, they have different roles. So Olivia's statement is false. But Olivia is a Spy, so she can say either true or false - this alone is not a contradiction. Now check Ivy. By s-005, Ivy is not a spy, so Ivy is Knight or Knave.\n\nStep 12: Case B.1.a: Alice=Knave, Olivia=Spy, Ivy=Knight. Ivy says \"Alice and I have the same role\" (s-004). Alice=Knave, Ivy=Knight, so they have different roles. Ivy's statement is false. But Ivy is a Knight (always tells truth). Contradiction.\n\nStep 13: Case B.1.b: Alice=Knave, Olivia=Spy, Ivy=Knave. Ivy says \"Alice and I have the same role\" (s-004). Alice=Knave, Ivy=Knave, so they have the SAME role. Ivy's statement is true. But Ivy is a Knave (always lies). Contradiction.\n\nStep 14: Cases B.1.a and B.1.b exhaust all possibilities for Ivy when Olivia=Spy. Both lead to contradictions. Therefore if Alice=Knave, then Olivia is not the Spy.\n\nStep 15: Case B.2: Suppose Alice=Knave and Ivy=Spy. By s-005 and Alice=Knave, Ivy=Spy, Olivia is not the spy. So Olivia is Knight or Knave.\n\nStep 16: Case B.2.a: Alice=Knave, Ivy=Spy, Olivia=Knight. Olivia says \"Alice and I have the same role\" (s-002). Alice=Knave, Olivia=Knight, so they have different roles. Olivia's statement is false. But Olivia is a Knight (always tells truth). Contradiction.\n\nStep 17: Case B.2.b: Alice=Knave, Ivy=Spy, Olivia=Knave. Olivia says \"Alice and I have the same role\" (s-002). Alice=Knave, Olivia=Knave, so they have the SAME role. Olivia's statement is true. But Olivia is a Knave (always lies). Contradiction.\n\nStep 18: Cases B.2.a and B.2.b exhaust all possibilities for Olivia when Ivy=Spy. Both lead to contradictions. Therefore if Alice=Knave, then Ivy is not the Spy.\n\nStep 19: By Steps 14 and 18, if Alice=Knave, neither Olivia nor Ivy is the Spy. But by s-005, there is exactly one spy among the three players. Since Alice is not a spy (by Case B assumption), the spy must be Olivia or Ivy. This contradicts Steps 14 and 18. Therefore Alice is not a Knave.\n\nStep 20: By Steps 8 and 19, Alice is neither Knight nor Knave. By s-001, Alice must be the Spy.\n\nStep 21: Given Alice=Spy, by s-005, Olivia and Ivy are each Knight or Knave. We analyze Olivia's possibilities.\n\nStep 22: Case C.1: Alice=Spy and Olivia=Knight. Olivia says \"Alice and I have the same role\" (s-002). Alice=Spy, Olivia=Knight, so they have different roles. Olivia's statement is false. But Olivia is a Knight (always tells truth). Contradiction. Therefore Olivia is not a Knight.\n\nStep 23: By Step 22, Olivia=Knave (the only remaining option given s-001 and s-005).\n\nStep 24: Given Alice=Spy and Olivia=Knave, analyze Ivy. By s-005, Ivy is Knight or Knave.\n\nStep 25: Case C.2.a: Alice=Spy, Olivia=Knave, Ivy=Knight. Ivy says \"Alice and I have the same role\" (s-004). Alice=Spy, Ivy=Knight, so they have different roles. Ivy's statement is false. But Ivy is a Knight (always tells truth). Contradiction.\n\nStep 26: By Step 25, Ivy is not a Knight. Therefore Ivy=Knave.\n\nStep 27: The only consistent assignment is Alice=Spy, Olivia=Knave, Ivy=Knave. By Step 6, this assignment satisfies all constraints. By s-006, there is a unique solution. Therefore the unique solution is: Olivia=Knave, Alice=Spy, Ivy=Knave. QED.",
