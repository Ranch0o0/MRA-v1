Given there's exactly 1 spy, if 6 people had the same role they'd all be Knights or Knaves. This would require the remaining 2 (including Xavier and Bob) to contain the 1 spy. Since Xavier's statement is demonstrably false (analysis shows role diversity is required), Xavier must be lying, making him a Knave.",
